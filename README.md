<h2>Introduction to Composites</h2>
Composites are made by combining two or more natural or artificial materials to maximize their useful properties and minimize their weaknesses. One of the oldest and best-known composites, glass-fiber reinforced plastic (GRP), combines glass fibers (which are strong but brittle) with plastic (which is flexible) to make a composite material that is tough but not brittle. Composites are typically used in place of metals because they are equally strong but much lighter.

<h2>Applications</h2>
<h3>Airbus A380</h3>
More than 20 % of the A380 is made of composite materials, mainly plastic reinforced with carbon fibres. The design is the first large-scale use of glass-fibre-reinforced aluminium, a new composite that is 25 % stronger than conventional airframe aluminium but 20 % lighter.
<h3>Concrete</h3>
Concrete is a versatile and cheap material, with a vast range of applications around the home. Brick laying, constructing paths and driveways, foundations to buildings and walls, are some of the practical applications. Concrete has a similarly wide and varied range in industrial applications.
<h3>Wind Turbine</h3>
Currently, carbon fiber is used primarily in the spar, or structural element, of wind blades longer than 45m/148 ft, both for land-based and offshore systems. The higher stiffness and lower density of CF allows a thinner blade profile while producing stiffer, lighter blades.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
Since precise material properties are often needed to satisfy industrial needs and criteria, design of composites with tailored properties is of utmost importance.
<br>
The design and analysis of such composites faces following challenges -
<br>
<ul>
<li>Computational Expense</li>
<li>Heavy Simulations</li>
<li>Rigorous Experimentation</li>
<li>Time Expensive Process</li>
</ul>
